## Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

Everyone who participates in this training course is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces related to the course including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. If necessary trainers will enforce the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which we resolve any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.

## Expected behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

## Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender and/or ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund).
