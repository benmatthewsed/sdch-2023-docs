## Pre-Reading

Before the Hackathon it will be useful to familiarize yourself with the data source we're going to be using, and some of the relevant policy background. We have included some links below that it might be useful to review.

About the [Scottish Crime and Justice Survey](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-crime-and-justice-survey/):
- [Interactive Data Tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-scottish-crime-justice-survey/). We *strongly* recommend taking a few minutes to look through the Interactive Data Tool and have a look at trends in some of the SCJS variables over time and by police division. The data we're using for the Hackathon will draw on many of the same variables, so the data tool is a good way to get a jump on the analysis for the Hackathon.
- [Scottish Crime and Justice Survey 2019/20: main findings](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-crime-justice-survey-2019-20-main-findings/). This is Scottish Government's main report on SCJS, which covers a wide number of headline statistics and trends from the survey.
- [Scottish Crime and Justice Survey 2019/20: Technical Report](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2021/02/scottish-crime-and-justice-survey-2019-20-supplementary-documents/documents/scjs-2019-20---technical-report/scjs-2019-20---technical-report/govscot%3Adocument/2019_20%2BSCJS%2B-%2BTechnical%2BReport2.pdf). This provides a lot of technical detail about the SCJS.
- [Scottish Crime and Justice Survey 2019/20: Questionnaire and User Notes](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2021/02/scottish-crime-and-justice-survey-2019-20-supplementary-documents/documents/scjs-2019-20---questionnaire/scjs-2019-20---questionnaire/govscot%3Adocument/SCJS%2B2019_20%2B-%2BQuestionnaire.pdf). This provides the most granular details about the questions in SCJS, including how different variables are coded and suchlike.

Scottish Government recently published an evidence review of [Ethnicity in the justice system](https://www.gov.scot/publications/ethnicity-justice-system/) which draws on analysis of the linked SCJS, similar to the dataset that we will be analysing in the Hackathon.

A short list of topical policy documents relating to policing in Scotland:
- [Joint Strategy for Policing 2023-26](https://www.spa.police.uk/spa-media/m3odwrfe/item-9-design-version-joint-strategy-for-policing-2023-26.pdf)

- [Public Contact and Engagement Strategy](https://www.scotland.police.uk/spa-media/qbyfwwyu/public-contact-and-engagement-strategy.pdf)

And another short list of policy documents relating to community justice in Scotland:
- [Community Justice Performance Framework](https://www.gov.scot/publications/community-justice-performance-framework/)
- [The Vision for Justice in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/publications/vision-justice-scotland/)

## Finding information about SCJS

You can find all the Questionnaires, Technical Reports and User Guides for the SCJS at the [Scottish Government SCJS collection](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-crime-and-justice-survey/). 

Questionnaires, Technical Reports and User Guides for sweeps from 2016-17 onwards are listed under Supplementary Documents for each year. For surveys prior to 2016/17 all the documentation is hosted on the linked page at the [NRS National Web Archive](https://webarchive.nrscotland.gov.uk/20200117001347/https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Crime-Justice/crime-and-justice-survey/publications).
