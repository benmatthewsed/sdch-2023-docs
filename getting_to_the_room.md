# Getting to the room

Lister Learning and Teaching Centre is located at 5 Roxburgh Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9SU.

## Getting to the building:
Buses run regularly to Nicolson street, which is a few minutesâ€™ walk round the corner from Roxburgh Place (either along Drummond Street or Hill Place).

Itâ€™s around a 10-15 minute walk from Edinburgh Waverly. For an early morning workout, take the Market Street exit (exit 3 on the station map) at the station and up the stairs on â€˜Fleshmarket closeâ€™, or exit via Waverly Bridge (exit 2) and head left, travelling up Cockburn Street. For a glimpse of Arthurâ€™s Seat, exit via Princes Street (exit 1), taking a right, and right again over North Bridge.

Currently, there are large red â€˜road closedâ€™ barriers just outside the building on Roxburgh Place, but there is pedestrian access along the pavement.

## Inside the building:

Enter through the revolving doors at the front of the building. 2.14 is on the second floor of the building. Stairs can be found to the right hand side of the reception desk. A lift is available immediately to the left as you enter the building. If using the lift, press the â€˜2â€™ button on the left hand column of buttons (this will open the doors in front of you as you enter the lift).

There will be â€˜SCCJR Hackathonâ€™ signs up on level 2 to guide you ðŸ˜Š

There is no need to sign in at the reception desk.

## Facilities:

- Gender neutral toilets and accessible toilets are available on level 2.
- The water fountain on level 2 is currently out of service.
- There will be power plugs for laptop charging.
- Fire alarm testing is on Friday, so if there is an alarm it is real. Please make your way down the stairs and out of the nearest exit.
